## a sales prediction for food items sold at various stores 

### Business problem:

When is the last time your sales hit or exceeded its quota? And how often do you achieve such a feat?

It can be frustrating to deal with continuous failures to increase your sales time and time again. It feels even worse when you have done everything you think you should improve your sales teamâ€™s performance. 

There may be other factors at play that you have not considered. Understanding how such factors affect your sales is the first step toward improving your sales as a retailer. 

The goal of this project is to help the retailer understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in increasing sales.

    - During the exploratory data analysis, a boxplot and histogram was visualized for numeric datatype column. 
    - Also, a barplot was visualized for categorical column. 
    - This gave a good baseline for all of the numeric and categorical columns for univariate EDA.
